# So you've found a bug and want to do something about it?

All the libraries for Pimoroni products are available online and can be modified by anyone, so let's go!

First things first, head over to the [Pimoroni GitHub page](https://github.com/pimoroni). On this page you'll find a listing of all the wonderful repositories maintained by the folks at Pimoroni. Generally there's one for each product/board that they produce, so go ahead and select the relevant repository. The examples on this page refer to the [Mote repository](https://github.com/pimoroni/Mote) which is pinned to the Pimoroni landing page.

## Repository Homepage
The repository homepage shows an overview of what's going on with the repository. For now we're interested in the issues list, so click "Issues" at the top of the page.

## The Issues List
The issues page shows a list of the 'active' issues that have been raised against the repository. These may be bugs, suggestions or new functionality. First check that the issue you've found isn't already present in this list.

## Raising an Issue
If the issue you've found is new, click "New issue" - at this point go ahead and create a GitHub account if you haven't already. Fill in as much information as you can about the issue. For example you might include the steps required to reproduce it. 

Once you've submitted the issue anyone is free to attempt to fix it, that could be the people of at Pimoroni, another GitHub user or yourself! If you know how to fix the issue, continue reading...
